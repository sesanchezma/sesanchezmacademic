Hi, I am [[Sebastián] [Sánchez Martínez](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_customs_of_Hispanic_America)]. Philosophy is my business. This is my academic webpage.

So, I’m a fourth-year PhD student with a DAAD-grant researching at the [TU Dresden’s Institute of Philosophy](https://tu-dresden.de/gsw/phil/iphil/personen/uebersicht). Before this, I worked a couple of years at the [Universidad Tecnológica de Pereira](https://artes.utp.edu.co/licenciatura-bilinguismo/sin-categoria/mision/).

In short, my main research interests are in epistemology and theories of rationality in different disciplines, like psychology, economics, and decision theory. I’m mainly interested in how limitations in human and non-human reasoners (like limits in memory, computation, and time) can affect theories of justification and rationality. Currently, I am finishing a dissertation on simplified reasoning, drawing on contemporary traditions of bounded rationality. As a side interest, I work on foundational and applied aspects of speech-act theory.
